## User Story

**As an** API consumer,
**I want to** authenticate users,
**So that** they can access their account, order history, and saved details.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Successful login with valid credentials

**Given** the API server is running with seeded data
**When** I send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/login` with body:
```json
{
  "email": "jamie@flowlinesupply.com",
  "password": "demo123"
}
```
**Then** the response status code is `200`
**And** the response body contains `access_token` (non-empty string)
**And** the response body contains `token_type` with value `"bearer"`
**And** the response body contains `expires_at` (ISO 8601 datetime string)
**And** the response body contains a `user` object
**And** the response body contains an `addresses` array
**And** the response body contains a `payment_methods` array
**And** the response body contains an `orders` array

### AC-2: Token validity is 4 hours

**Given** a successful login
**When** I inspect the `expires_at` field
**Then** it is approximately 4 hours in the future from the current UTC time

### AC-3: User object contains correct data

**Given** a successful login with `jamie@flowlinesupply.com`
**When** I inspect the `user` object
**Then** it contains `"email": "jamie@flowlinesupply.com"`
**And** it contains `"full_name": "Jamie Rivera"` (returned via `User.to_dict()`)

### AC-4: Addresses are returned

**Given** a successful login with `jamie@flowlinesupply.com`
**When** I inspect the `addresses` array
**Then** it contains 2 address objects
**And** the first address has `"label": "Home"` and `"city": "San Francisco"`
**And** the second address has `"label": "Studio"` and `"city": "San Francisco"`

### AC-5: Payment methods are returned (masked)

**Given** a successful login with `jamie@flowlinesupply.com`
**When** I inspect the `payment_methods` array
**Then** it contains 2 payment method objects
**And** the first has `"brand": "Visa"` and `"last4": "4242"`
**And** the second has `"brand": "Amex"` and `"last4": "3782"`
**And** each payment method includes a `display` field (masked card string)

### AC-6: Orders are returned with PDF links

**Given** a successful login with `jamie@flowlinesupply.com`
**When** I inspect the `orders` array
**Then** it contains 2 order objects
**And** each order includes: `id`, `order_number`, `status`, `total`, `created_at`
**And** each order includes `invoice_url` matching pattern `/api/docs/orders/{id}/invoice.pdf`
**And** each order includes `summary_url` matching pattern `/api/docs/orders/{id}/summary.pdf`

### AC-7: Orders are sorted by creation date descending

**Given** a successful login with `jamie@flowlinesupply.com`
**When** I inspect the `orders` array
**Then** orders are sorted with the most recent order first

### AC-8: Invalid credentials return 401

**Given** the API server is running with seeded data
**When** I send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/login` with body:
```json
{
  "email": "jamie@flowlinesupply.com",
  "password": "wrongpassword"
}
```
**Then** the response status code is `401`
**And** the response body contains `{"detail": "Invalid credentials"}`

### AC-9: Non-existent user returns 401

**Given** the API server is running with seeded data
**When** I send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/login` with body:
```json
{
  "email": "nonexistent@example.com",
  "password": "anything"
}
```
**Then** the response status code is `401`
**And** the response body contains `{"detail": "Invalid credentials"}`

### AC-10: Second test user can log in

**Given** the API server is running with seeded data
**When** I send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/login` with body:
```json
{
  "email": "alex.productlead@example.com",
  "password": "flowline"
}
```
**Then** the response status code is `200`
**And** the `user` object contains `"full_name": "Alex Morgan"`
**And** the `addresses` array contains 1 address
**And** the `payment_methods` array contains 1 payment method
**And** the `orders` array contains 1 order

### AC-11: Email validation

**Given** the API server is running
**When** I send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/login` with body `{"email": "not-valid", "password": "demo123"}`
**Then** the response status code is `422` (validation error)

## Notes

- The token is generated using SHA-256 hash of email + expiry + random hex. It is not a standard JWT; it is an opaque token.
- Passwords are stored as SHA-256 hashes of the plain-text password.
- The `LoginResponse` Pydantic model enforces the response schema.
- The `user.to_dict()` method returns the user's public fields. The exact fields depend on the `User` model implementation.
- Orders are eagerly loaded with their items via `selectinload`.
- Payment method `display` field uses the `PaymentMethod.masked()` method.
- No rate limiting is implemented on the login endpoint.
